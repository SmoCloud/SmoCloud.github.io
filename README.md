# My Portfolio

This is the root directory of what will eventually become my online portfolio. I hope to move it to a custom domain, but for now, standard GitHub Pages works.

# React + TypeScript + Vite

This portfolio is made using React/TSX with Vite as the build system. Right now, it's just a barebones portrait and description of myself, but it will change over time.
